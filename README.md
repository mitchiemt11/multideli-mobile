## Technologies
- React Native
- Redux
- Typescript
- React Navigation (Third party library)
- Bottom sheet (Third party library)

## Setup
- Download or clone the repository
  `git clone https://github.com/mitchiemt11/multideli-mobile.git`

- To install all dependencies, run ` yarn install`

 
## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run the app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.



## Approach
- I used Redux for centralized state management, ensuring that all order data is stored in a single global state accessible from any component.
- TypeScript was integrated to enhance the development experience with static typing, catching potential errors and providing better code documentation.
- React Navigation was employed for easy navigation between screens, offering a straightforward API and support for various navigation patterns with the `route` and `navigation` props playing a bigger part in moving betweenn screens at the same time passing the correct data to the components.
- The `useSelector` hook provided by Redux was utilized to selectively extract data from the global state, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
- Additionally, I integrated a bottom sheet local library to enhance user experience, providing a smooth and intuitive way to interact with certain features without obstructing the main content.
